# Project Learning Agreement
## Gig-Ready Full-Stack Web Developer (6-Month Plan)

This repository follows a **fluency-first, gig-focused learning agreement**.
This file is intentionally placed first and should be read before anything else.

---

## 🎯 Primary Objective

Build the skills required to **accept, complete, and deliver paid full-stack web development gigs** within six months.

If something does **not** help with real client work, it is optional or excluded.

---

## 🧠 Learning Philosophy (Fluency-First)

- Understanding over memorization  
- Calm reasoning over speed  
- Debugging over guessing  
- Small stack, deeply understood  

Feeling rushed = slow down.

---

## 🧱 Mental Model Before Syntax

For every concept:
1. What problem does this solve?
2. How does the browser/server think about it?
3. What exists already?
4. What changes, and why?

Code comes **after** understanding.

---

## ✂️ Minimalism Rule

- Smallest possible example
- One idea at a time
- No option dumping
- No framework hopping
- One backend stack only

---

## 🔮 Prediction Before Execution

Before running code:
- Predict what will happen
- Explain why

This builds real debugging skill.

---

## 🧪 Controlled Breakage Is Required

Break things intentionally:
- Invalid CSS
- Wrong selectors
- Broken requests

Inspect, explain, fix calmly.

---

## 🗣️ Explain-Back Requirement

Every lesson must be explainable in **2–3 simple sentences**.
If it can’t be explained simply, it isn’t owned yet.

---

## 🔁 Rebuild From Understanding

Rebuild means:
- Same behavior
- Same idea
- Not the same code

Understanding > memory.

---

## ⏸️ Step-Gated Walkthrough Mode

Multi-step instructions follow checkpoint control.

Pause with:
```
PAUSE at Step X:
```

Resume with:
```
RESUME from Step X+1
```

You control pacing.

---

## 🧩 Project Strategy

- Few projects, grown deeply
- One main project evolves across months
- Projects are versioned, not abandoned
- Refactoring matters more than starting new things

---

## 💼 Gig-Reality Filter

Constant question:
> Would this help with a real client?

Priority skills:
- Layout fixes
- Responsiveness
- Forms + backend
- CRUD
- Deployment
- Debugging existing code
- Explaining decisions

---

## 📂 Portfolio Standard

Portfolio should look:
- Experienced, not busy
- Few strong projects
- Case-study driven
- Focused on decisions and fixes

---

## 🛠️ Tooling Discipline

- Git = snapshots you understand
- DevTools = primary debugger
- Logs over guessing
- One environment at a time

---

## 🧭 North Star

> Build someone who can accept paid work, stay calm, fix problems, and deliver.
