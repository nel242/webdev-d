# Fluency-first learning Rules

All lessons must follow this structure:

1. Mental model first (no code)
2. Minimal syntax only
3. Prediction checkpoint before running code
4. Intentional breakage and debugging
5. Explain-back in simple language
6. Rebuild from memory before moving on

Goal: fluency, not speed.
