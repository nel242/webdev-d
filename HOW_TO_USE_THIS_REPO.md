# How to Use This Repository

This repository is structured to support a **fluency-first, gig-ready full-stack learning path**.

Read this file after `README.md`.

---

## Repository Principles

- This is not a dump of random experiments.
- Every folder and file exists for a reason.
- Progress is measured by **understanding and delivery**, not volume.

---

## How to Navigate

### 1. Start at the root
Always read:
- `README.md` — the learning agreement
- `PROJECTS.md` — what projects exist and why

### 2. Monthly folders
Work is organized by month or phase:
```
month-1/
month-2/
month-3/
```

Each month may contain:
- Lessons
- Demos
- One evolving project

## How to Add New Work

Before creating anything new, ask:
> Does this support a real gig skill?

If yes:
- Create a clearly named folder
- Keep it small
- Document what you learned

---

## How to Commit

- Commit only when you understand what you did
- Use descriptive commit messages
- One logical change per commit

---

## When You Feel Lost

- Stop coding
- Open DevTools or logs
- Re-read `README.md`
- Reduce scope

This repo is a **training ground**, not a race.
