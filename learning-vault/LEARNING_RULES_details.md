# Fluency‑First Learning Rules

**Goal:** Build fluency, not speed. Understanding and calm reasoning matter more than finishing quickly.

All lessons must follow this structure. Skipping steps means the lesson is **not complete**.

---

## 1. Mental Model First (No Code)

* Start with *what problem this concept solves*
* Explain *how the browser thinks about it*
* No syntax until the idea is clear

---

## 2. Minimal Syntax Only

* Introduce the **smallest possible example**
* One purpose, one or two properties max
* Avoid dumping options or variations

---

## 3. Prediction Checkpoint

Before running the code, pause and answer:

* *What do I expect to happen?*
* *Why do I expect that?*

Only then:

* Save
* Refresh
* Observe

---

## 4. Controlled Breakage

* Intentionally break something (tag, selector, property)
* Inspect with DevTools
* Identify **what changed** and **why**
* Fix it calmly

Failure is part of the lesson.

---

## 5. Explain‑Back Requirement

At the end of the lesson:

* Explain the concept in **2–3 simple sentences**
* As if teaching a beginner

If it can’t be explained simply, it isn’t understood yet.

---

## 6. Rebuild From Memory (Fluency Gate)

Before moving on:

* Start from an empty folder
* Recreate the lesson result without looking
* Correctness matters more than perfection

Only after this step is the lesson considered complete.

---

## Daily Learning Principles

* Type code manually (no copy‑paste)
* Keep lessons isolated in separate folders
* Use DevTools to understand, not guess
* Commit to Git only when you understand

---

**Rule of Thumb:**

> If you feel rushed, slow down.
> If you can explain it calmly, you are learning correctly.
