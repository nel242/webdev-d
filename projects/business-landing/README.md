# Business Landing Page (Evolving Project)

This is my main evolving project on the path to becoming a **gig-ready full-stack web developer**.

Instead of creating many disconnected mini-projects, this project grows through clear versions (v1 → v4) to mirror real freelance work: iteration, refactoring, and extension.

## Versions

### v1 — Static Landing Page
**Goal:** Clean HTML structure + basic CSS styling.  
**Focus:** Semantics, layout basics, predictable rendering.

### v2 — Responsive Landing Page
**Goal:** Mobile-first layout that looks correct on all screen sizes.  
**Focus:** Box model, flexbox patterns, media queries, accessibility basics.

### v3 — Full-Stack Contact Form
**Goal:** The contact form actually sends data to a server.  
**Focus:** Node + Express, HTTP request/response, validation, logging.

### v4 — Persistence + Simple Admin View
**Goal:** Store submissions and view them in a simple admin UI.  
**Focus:** Database basics, CRUD, safe data handling.

## How to Use This Project

- Each version lives in its own folder.
- Older versions are never overwritten.
- Each version includes a `notes.md` capturing what changed and why.

## Deliverable Standard (Gig-Ready)

A version is considered “done” when:
- It works reliably
- It is understandable (not clever)
- It can be explained in plain language
- It can be debugged calmly with DevTools/logs
